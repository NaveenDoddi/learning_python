# loops in python
# loops is nothing but it continous interation of a number until unlesss of the last element of the programm 
# is called as loop
#  1. for loop
# for x in "123456":
#       print(x, "varaible name")

      # here x is getting loaded and triggered in print each and every time. once all the elements is completed it will come out

# RANGE function
#  range gunction is used to identify the capacity of a number or it is used to check number of iteration of a number 
# there are 3 types 

#    1. range(stop)
#     2. range(start, stop)
#       3. range(start, stop, step)

# note: all the range values stoping the iteration depends on the last element of (n-1).
# note: if the start is not given, then range function it starts from 0 by default

# range(4)
      # output: 0,1,2,3
# range(6, 10)
      # output: 6,7,8,9
# range(0, 10, 2)
      # output: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8
