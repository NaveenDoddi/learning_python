# data structures and algorithms
# data structers are the bulding blocks of the programs.
# dsa types:
# 1. list
# 2. tuple
# 3. set
# 4. dictonary
# 5. numpy
# 6. pandas
# 7. mat plot lib
# 8. siborn 
# 10. 1, 2, 3d array

# LIST

# list is the hetro genious collection of values.
# hetro genious is nothing but set of multiple datatypes

# why lists? 
# ans) in list single variable holding more than one value

# properties of list
# 1. it collects hetro genious values
# 2. it allows slicing and indexing 
# 3. the output of the list ordered
# 4. it allows duplicates
# 5. it is mutable(changable: add, delete)
#  note string in immutable in nature because it will not accept adding values and deleting the values
 

# example

# a = [3, 4, 'rama', 1.2,1, 2]
# print(a)
# a[3] = 'new'
# # a[10] = 10
# print(a)

# nested list
# list inside another list is called as nested list
# in the nested list when there is new list is created a new block memrory is created,  for that assigned position number

# newList = ['rama', 'sita', [10,20,66]]
# # to access 66 
# print(newList[2][2])

# newList = ['2023', [10,20,66,[12, 13, 15]],'sita']
# # to access 15
# to access t from 'sita'
# # print(newList[2][2])
# print(newList[1][3][2])

# students = [1,2,4,[99, 66, [66, 8899], 990]]
# # to print 990
# print(students[3][3])

# electronics = ['bulb', ['11', 'pp',[77], 88, [900, 909]]]
# # to print 909
# print(electronics[1][4][1])


# Interview 

# difference bw compiler and interpretor, assembler

# why str is immutable
# intendation of python
# wht is slicing and indexing
# write a logic for counting a number
# write a properties of list

# non technical

# tell me abt u r self
# y should hire u
# if u got higher package r u quuiting job
# what is ur futhure roel
# how many years u will be ok to work
